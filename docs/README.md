## Testing Scenarios

### RAG System Testing

#### Document Upload and Processing
1. Upload each document to test different file formats and content types
2. Verify document chunking and indexing
3. Test metadata extraction and storage

#### Semantic Search Testing
```
Test Queries:
- "What is machine learning?"
- "How do I implement MCP protocol?"
- "What are SOLID principles in software development?"
- "How to handle API authentication?"
- "What is Six Sigma methodology?"
```

#### Cross-Document Search
```
Complex Queries:
- "Compare agile methodologies in software development and BPM"
- "How can AI be used in business process automation?"
- "What security considerations apply to both APIs and MCP?"
```

### Memory System Testing

#### Short-term Memory
```
Conversation Flow:
User: "My name is Sarah and I'm a software engineer working on API development"
Bot: [Response acknowledging name and role]
User: "I'm particularly interested in REST API best practices"
Bot: [Should remember Sarah is a software engineer interested in APIs]
```

#### Long-term Memory
```
Multi-session Testing:
Session 1: Discuss AI and machine learning interests
Session 2: Ask about previous AI discussions (should recall from long-term memory)
Session 3: Combine AI knowledge with software development questions
```

#### Entity Extraction
```
Test Entities:
- Names: Sarah, John, companies, technologies
- Roles: software engineer, project manager, developer
- Technologies: Python, JavaScript, REST APIs, MCP
- Methodologies: Agile, Six Sigma, Lean
```

### Chatbot Engine Testing

#### Knowledge Integration
```
Multi-source Queries:
- "How would you implement AI in a business process management system?"
- "What are the security considerations for MCP protocol in enterprise software?"
- "How do agile development practices align with BPM methodologies?"
```

#### Context Awareness
```
Progressive Conversations:
1. Start with basic AI questions
2. Move to specific implementation details
3. Discuss integration with business processes
4. Test memory of entire conversation flow
```

### MCP Integration Testing

#### Tool Usage Simulation
```
Simulated MCP Tools:
- Document search across uploaded files
- Process analysis tools
- Code review assistants
- API testing utilities
```

#### Resource Access Testing
```
Resource Types:

### Stress Testing
1. **Large Documents**: Upload very large documents (>10MB)
2. **Complex Queries**: Multi-part questions requiring cross-document search
3. **Long Conversations**: Extended chat sessions with deep context
4. **Rapid Interactions**: Quick successive messages

## Quality Assurance

### Response Accuracy Testing
```
Verification Points:
- Factual accuracy of AI/ML information
- Correct MCP protocol details

- Proper API documentation references
- Valid BPM methodology descriptions
```

### Source Attribution Testing
```
Citation Verification:
- Responses should cite correct source documents
- Page numbers or sections should be accurate
- Multiple source integration should be clear
- Confidence scores should be reasonable
```

### Consistency Testing
```
Consistency Checks:
- Same questions should yield similar answers
- Cross-references between documents should be accurate
- Technical terminology should be used consistently
- Examples should be relevant and correct
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Multi-modal Testing
1. **Text + Code**: Questions about code examples in documents
2. **Diagrams + Text**: References to process diagrams and flowcharts
3. **Tables + Narrative**: Data extraction from tables and explanations

### Domain Expertise Testing
```
Expert-level Queries:
